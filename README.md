A computational biologist specialising in machine learning applications and large-scale biological data analysis. Currently completing my PhD at La Trobe University in collaboration with Agriculture Victoria Research, I develop innovative computational methods to analyse complex biological datasets and extract meaningful insights from multi-omics data.

With over a decade of experience spanning research and industry, I've successfully developed seven patented varieties and led multidisciplinary teams. My work has earned international recognition, including a product selected as Japan's Flower of the Year 2017, demonstrating my ability to translate complex research into practical solutions.
