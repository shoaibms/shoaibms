A computational biologist specializing in machine learning applications and large-scale biological data analysis. Currently completing my PhD at La Trobe University in collaboration with Agriculture Victoria Research, developing innovative computational methods to analyze complex biological datasets and extract meaningful insights from multi-omics data.

> With over a decade of experience spanning research and industry, I've successfully developed seven patented varieties and led multidisciplinary teams. My work has earned international recognition, including a product selected as Japan's Flower of the Year 2017, demonstrating my ability to translate complex research into practical solutions.
